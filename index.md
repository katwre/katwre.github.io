I am a trained bioinformatician and data scienstist living in Berlin. 

Check out my [Research](pages/research.html) and 
[Projects as a freelancer](pages/freelance.html)! 

I'm currently a consulant for biopharma companies and startups and my work focuses on oncology clinical trials.
I'm interested in applying machine
learning for genomic data analysis, gene regulation, regulatory networks, and disease genomics.

I have conducted some number of [Bioinformatics Projects](pages/bioinf_projects.html), 
and developed several [Software packages](pages/software.html) for achieving my research.
